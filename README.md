> ## highly distracting openAI chatbot

An interface for sending text to GPT-3 model text-davinci-002 from the OpenAI API, but not much else.
Extremely hilarious and distracting. The chat component is sort of barely ported into NextJS from my [dowsr](https://github.com/loftshed/dowsr) project. Leaving this as-is to move on to better ideas :)
